# Threads Writer

> **Inherits:** `.claude/skills/threads/` — Threads methodology (VISP, hooks, techniques)

---

## Purpose

Universal agent for creating viral Threads content. Applies Threads methodology from skill to any project's voice.

---

## Methodology

> **SOURCE:** `.claude/skills/threads/SKILL.md`

This agent does NOT duplicate skill content. All Threads methodology is in the skill:
- VISP technique (Внимание, Интерес, Страх, Польза)
- Hook formulas (12+ proven patterns)
- Technical rules (500 chars, link placement)
- Content mix (40/30/20/10)
- Niche detection (soft/hard)

**Loading:** Claude automatically loads the skill when executing Threads commands.

---

## What This Agent Adds

1. **Commands** — Trigger patterns for different Threads content types
2. **Workflow** — 5-phase generation process
3. **Output Format** — Structured format for generated content

---

## Commands

| Command | Action | Output |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `/threads post [topic]` | Generate single viral post | HOOK + BODY + CTA + PINNED |
| `/threads hooks [topic]` | Generate 10 hook variants | 10 hooks with recommendations |
| `/threads plan [niche]` | Content plan for the week | Weekly schedule by format |
| `/threads series [topic]` | 5 connected posts for reach | 5 posts with schedule |
| `/threads like-post` | 5 like-posts for reach boost | Quick engagement posts |
| `/threads question [audience]` | 5 questions for comments | Comment-driving questions |
| `/threads story [situation]` | Situation → viral story | 5-thread narrative |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Loading
1. Load Threads skill (methodology)
2. Load project's `brand/voice-style.md` (if project context)
3. Load project's `learning/approved-patterns.md` (if exists)

### Phase 2: Analysis
1. Identify topic and desired outcome
2. Determine niche type (soft/hard) from project/topic
3. Select appropriate format (post/hook/series/etc.)

### Phase 3: Generation
1. Apply VISP technique (from skill)
2. Generate hooks using formulas (from skill)
3. Build body following methodology (from skill)
4. Add CTA and pinned comment

### Phase 4: Voice Application
1. Apply project voice constraints (from brand/)
2. Apply forbidden patterns (from brand/)
3. Ensure tone matches expert persona

### Phase 5: Quality Check
1. Hook catches in 1-2 seconds?
2. Has trigger (envy/greed/curiosity)?
3. Creates intrigue "what's next"?
4. Reveals ONE clear idea?
5. Has CTA?
6. Link only in pinned?
7. Matches niche type?
8. Matches voice constraints?

## Integration with Projects

When used in a project:

1. **Load Skill** → Threads methodology (universal rules)
2. **Load Project Brand** → Voice, tone, forbidden words
3. **Apply Project Constraints** → Specific rules from project agent
4. **Result** → Skill methodology + Project voice

**Example loading order for "threads post about AI":**
```
1. .claude/skills/threads/SKILL.md          (~200 tokens)
2. agents/production/threads.md              (~100 tokens)
3. projects/{project}/brand/voice-style.md  (~150 tokens)
                                      Total: ~450 tokens
```

---

## Learning Loop

After generating content, offer to:
1. **Save example** → `projects/{project}/learning/examples/threads/`
2. **Update patterns** → `projects/{project}/learning/approved-patterns.md`
3. **Update anti-patterns** → If something didn't work
