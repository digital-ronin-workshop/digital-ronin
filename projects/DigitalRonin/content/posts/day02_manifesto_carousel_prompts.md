## Caption
**Код — это новый станок.**

Я искал свободу 10 лет. В автостопе, в покере, в столярке.
Но везде находил новую клетку.
Пока не понял: героизм — это следствие сломанной системы.

Если ты должен совершать подвиг каждый день — ты раб.
Я выбрал код. Не потому что "IT", а потому что это рычаг.
Это станок, который работает, пока я сплю.
