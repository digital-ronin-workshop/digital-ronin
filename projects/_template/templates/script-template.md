## Example: Short Script

```
HOOK (Visual: Stop watch ticking)
"I wasted six months creating content."

PROBLEM
"Every day I posted. Zero growth. I was doing it all wrong."

SOLUTION
"Then I learned this:

Don't create for everyone. Create for ONE person.

I picked my ideal client. Used their exact words. Spoke to their specific pain.

Within thirty days:
- Engagement up three hundred percent
- DMs flooded
- First five clients signed"

RESULT
"Generic content equals invisible content."

CTA
"Follow for more content strategy. Tomorrow I'm sharing my hook formula."
```
