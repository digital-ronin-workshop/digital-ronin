## Example Post

```
Ever feel like your content isn't reaching anyone?

I spent 6 months posting daily with zero growth.

Then I changed ONE thing:

• Stopped creating for "everyone"
• Started speaking to ONE specific person
• Used their exact words in my hooks

Within 30 days:
→ Engagement up 300%
→ DMs flooded with questions
→ First 5 clients signed

The lesson? Generic content = invisible content.

Try this: Pick one person from your audience. Write your next post ONLY for them. Use language they use.

Watch what happens.

What's the biggest mistake you see in content?
