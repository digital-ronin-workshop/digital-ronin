## Best Practices

### Working with Variables
- Tokens in brackets `[SUBJECT]`, `[COLOR]` must be replaced
- Replacements should be specific: "bright color" → "neon orange #FF6A00"

### Personal Photos
- One clear photo (portrait/waist up), frontal, neutral background
- Use one reference photo for consistency
- Avoid face coverings (glasses, hats)

### Brand & Product
- Logos in vector or PNG with transparent background
- Specify material, surface type, and lighting
- Brand colors strictly by hex codes

### Quality & Consistency
- Render at target size immediately
- Fix seed for reproducibility
- For series: same lens, light, background settings

### Troubleshooting
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Faces "floating" | Increase identity strength, simplify scene |
| Text distorting | Reduce angle, shorten text |
| Colors "drifting" | Re-specify hex code |
